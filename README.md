# RevEngTools
Reverse engineering tools for scientific computation FORTRAN code

https://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/bitstream/11375/21347/1/Dragon_Olivier_E._2006Jul_Masters..pdf

# Dependencies

See .classpath file.

* ANTLR 2.7.5
* stringtemplate
* colt
* commons-collections-3.1
* jung 1.7.1
* jopenmaple and externalcall (Maple 10)

# Building

 1. Set the environment variables JAVAC and JAVARUN to be the path to your java 1.5 compiler and virtual machine respectively (e.g. JAVAC=/usr/bin/javac)
 2. Set the environment variable MAPLE to maple's root directory (e.g. MAPLE=/usr/local/maple10)
 3. Run the `make` command (The ANTLR jar library is in the repository and so all that is needed to build is to have the environment variables set)

# Running the reverse engineering tool

You will need to have Perl installed. Then all you need to do is make the rev.pl script executable, and then run it with the command `./rev.pl`
